	Having problems keeping your meat fresh on your tribal playthrough?
	
	This mod will allow you to keep them safe from rotting by introducing a popular technique from the 18th century.
	
	Keep your meat fresh by adding big amounts of salt to it. They will last a lot more of time and you can also mix some spices and let them dry for a long time in order to get the most delicious sausages Rimworld has ever seen.
